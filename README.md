### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafael and I'm a master of engineering student. I'm currently working on my master thesis wich is about quadrotor navigation and control with DRL, you can take a look at my project [here](https://github.com/rafaelcostafrf/autonomous_quadrotor_environment).

I'm working with some other side projects as well, mainly with machine learning techniques, DRL algorithms and ROS environments. 

I'm mainly a Python programmer, with good experience in Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pytorch, Pandas, OpenCV and Rospy. I also have some knowledge on Keras, Tensorflow and Scikitlearn. I have also worked with C, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Matlab, Simulink and Labview.

My next big project is going to be translating my python packages of quadrotor dynamics and control to a ROS environment, so they can be more easily used, have better performance and a more general use.
